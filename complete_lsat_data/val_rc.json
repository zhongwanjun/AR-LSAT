One approach was to emphasize that facilities were not in fact equal and to pursue litigation whose practical goal was the improvement both of opportunity for African Americans and of the facilities themselves. A second, more theoretical, approach was to argue that the concept of separate but equal facilities for the races was by its very nature impossible to fulfill,rendering the doctrine self-contradictory and hence legally unsound. Marshall correctly believed that the latter approach would eventually be the one to bring repeal of the doctrine,but felt it necessary in the short term to argue several cases using the former approach,in order to demonstrate the numerous ways in which segregation prevented real equality and thus to prepare the courts to recognize the validity of the theoretical argument. While Marshall enjoyed several successes arguing for the equalization of facilities and opportunities in such areas as voting pracices and accommodations for graduate students at public universities,it would be twelve years before he evolved a strategy for arguing against pervasive discriminatory practices that enabled him to make the leap from individual instances of inequality to the broader social argument needed to later invalidate \"separate but equal.\" In 1948,Marshall litigated Shelley v.Kraemer,in which he convinced the court to outlaw housing discrimination practiced by private parties. Although the court had previously supported such practices implicitly under a doctrine that excused private dealings from the legal requirement for equal protection of citizens under law,Marshall presented sociological data demonstrating that,in sum and over time,these individual transactions constituted a pattern of insupportable discrimination. Marshall later used this strategy when arguing against individual schools' enrollment restrictions in Brown; scholars argue that his successful use of the strategy in Shelley prepared the court to accept such data as convincing evidence for finding \"separate but equal\" insupportable on its face.", "question": "The primary purpose of the passage is to", "answers": ["reveal the details of Marshall's career before he litigated Brown v.

As the owner of five small copy shops serving several educational institutions in the area, he argued, as have others in the photocopy business, that the current process for obtaining permissions is time-consuming, cumbersome, and expensive. He also maintained that course packs, which are ubiquitous in higher education, allow professors to assign important readings in books and journals too costly for students to be expected to purchase individually. While the use of copyrighted material for teaching purposes is typically protected by certain provisions of copyright law, this case was unique in that the copying of course packs was done by a copy shop and at a profit. Copyright law outlines several factors involved in determining whether the use of copyrighted material is protected, including: whether it is for commercial or nonprofit purposes; the nature of the copyrighted work; the length and importance of the excerpt used in relation to the entire work; and the effect of its use on the work's potential market value. In bringing suit, the publishers held that other copy-shop owners would cease paying permission fees, causing the potential value of the copyrighted works of scholarship to diminish. Nonetheless, the court decided that this reasoning did not demonstrate that course packs would have a sufficiently adverse effect on the current or potential market of the copyrighted works or on the value of the copyrighted works themselves. The court instead ruled that since the copies were for educational purposes, the fact that the copy-shop owner had profited from making the course packs did not prevent him from receiving protection under the law. According to the court, the owner had not exploited copyrighted material because his fee was not based on the content of the works he copied; he charged by the page, regardless of whether the content was copyrighted.

Renewable sources of electricity, such as solar radiation, wind, and waterpower, are possible solutions to the problems caused by increasing demand for electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are available in virtually all geographic regions, and they allow electricity production without dangerous environmental pollutants. Additionally, these sources can usually be located closer to consumers than can plants that use fossil fuels, thus reducing transmission and distribution costs.

In rural Brazil, for example, millions of citizens do not have electricity, and the lack of necessary infrastructure has limited efforts to provide it. In 1992, an energy agency from the United States developed a joint project with two Brazilian states to install 800 household solar electrical systems and train local personnel to service them. Under the project's terms, local utilities install, maintain, and own the systems, and collect fees from users. Backers hoped the project would attract enough private investment for substantial expansion throughout Brazil. But the project directors rejected the relatively high bids of local Brazilian companies to produce the solar collectors and thus missed an opportunity to stimulate local production. Consequently, a short-term savings in start-up costs precluded the long-term benefits deriving from the development of local production capacity and technological skill, which eventually would have led to independence from costly foreign expertise. As a result, participating utilities can generate only enough income to cover operating and maintenance costs, which makes further investment and expansion unlikely. Thus, the movement toward a sustainable, rural electricity system in Brazil remains stalled. But some efforts have avoided these pitfalls.

On some of the plots sown with seeds of native plant species, soil from nearby land that had been taken out of production 20 years earlier was scattered to see what effect introducing nematodes, fungi, and other beneficial microorganisms associated with later stages of natural soil development might have on the process of native plant repopulation. The seeds sown on these enriched plots have fared better than seeds sown on the unenriched plots, but still not as well as those growing naturally on the nearby land. Researchers have concluded that this is because fields farmed for many years are overrun with aggressive disease organisms, while, for example, beneficial mycorrhiza\u2014 fungi that live symbiotically on plant roots and Strengthen them against the effects of disease organisms\u2014are lacking. These preliminary results suggest that restoring natural plant diversity to overfarmed land hinges on restoring a natural balance of microorganisms in the soil. In other words, diversity underground fosters diversity aboveground. Researchers now believe that both kinds of diversity can be restored more quickly to damaged land if beneficial microorganisms are \"sown\" systematically into the soil along with a wide variety of native plant seeds.", "question": "Which one of the following is most analogous to the process, described in the last paragraph, by which the spread of thistles can be curtailed?", "answers": ["A newspaper works to prevent Party A from winning a majority of seats in the legislature by publishing editorials encouraging that party's supporters to switch their allegiance and vote for candidates from a rival party.", "A newspaper works to prevent Party A from winning a majority of seats in the legislature by publishing editorials defending candidates from a rival party against attacks by certain broadcast journalists.", "A newspaper works to prevent Party A from winning a majority of seats in the legislature by publishing editorials intended to discourage supporters of Party A from voting in the upcoming election.", "A newspaper works to prevent Party A from winning a majority of seats in the legislature by publishing editorials attacking certain public figures who support candidates from Party A.", "A newspaper works to prevent Party A from winning a majority of seats in the legislature by publishing editorials intended to create antagonism between two factions within that party."], "label": 1, "id_string": "201112_3-RC_4_27"}, {"context": "Until my present study, African American entertainer Lorenzo Tucker had not been extensively discussed in histories of United States theater and film.

If a sovereign does have unlimited legal power, then the sovereign presumably has the legal power to limit or even completely abdicate its own legal power. But doing so would mean that the sovereign no longer has unlimited legal power, thereby contradicting the initial supposition. This theoretical conundrum is traditionally known as the paradox of omnipotence.Social scientists have recognized that sovereign omnipotence can be a source of considerable practical difficulty for sovereigns themselves. Douglass North and Barry Weingast show that English and French monarchies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries confronted a practical challenge created by the paradox of their own omnipotence. North and Weingast point out that it is often in a sovereign's best interest to make a credible commitment not to perform certain acts. For example, a sovereign with absolute power can refuse to honor its financial commitments. Yet creditors will not voluntarily lend generous amounts at favorable terms to an absolute monarch who can renege upon debts at will. In the struggle to expand their empires, the English and French monarchies required vast amounts of capital. At the outset of the seventeenth century, however, neither regime could credibly commit itself to repay debts or to honor property rights. The absence of limitations upon the legal power of monarchs meant that there was no law or commitment monarchs could make that they could not also unmake or disregard. Consequently, these monarchs earned a reputation for expropriating wealth, repudiating debts, and reneging upon commitments. Not surprisingly, creditors took such behavior into account and demanded higher interest rates from monarchs than from the monarchs' wealthy subjects. North and Weingast argue that the constitutional settlement imposed in England by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 halted such faithless conduct. Henceforth, Parliament controlled the Crown's purse strings. Parliament, in turn, represented commercial interests that would not tolerate governmental disregard for property rights. The Crown's newfound inability to dishonor its commitments translated into a newfound ability to borrow: the Crown's borrowing increased and interest rates fell, because lenders concluded that the Crown would honor its debts. Thanks to North, Weingast, and others writing in the same vein, it is now conventional to hold that constitutional arrangements benefit sovereigns by limiting their power.

Whatley maintains that small farms can operate profitably despite these economic obstacles, and he provides guidelines that he believes will bring about such profitability when combined with smart management and hard work. Whatley emphasizes that small farms must generate year-round cash flow.

Whatley stresses that this \"pick-your-own\" farming is crucial for profitability because 50 percent of a farmer's production cost is tied up with harvesting, and using clients as harvesters allows the farmer to charge 60 percent of what supermarkets charge and still operate the farm at a profit.

Still, a court recently held that a technology company had infringed on patents covering computer servers that perform these translations. In an ideal world, patents would be narrow enough that companies could \"invent around\" others' patents if licensing agreements cannot be reached. Unfortunately, the patent system has departed from this ideal. In recent decades, the courts have dramatically lowered the bar for obviousness. As a result, some patents being granted are so broad that inventing around them is practically impossible. Large technology companies have responded to this proliferation of bad patents with the patent equivalent of nuclear stockpiling. By obtaining hundreds or even thousands of patents, a company can develop a credible deterrent against patent lawsuits: if someone sues it for patent infringement, it can find a patent the other company has infringed and countersue. Often, however, a fundamental mistake is made: not joining this arms race. As a result, a company can find itself defenseless against lawsuits. Software patents are particularly ripe for abuse because software is assembled from modular components. If the patent system allows those components to be patented, it becomes almost impossible to develop a software product without infringing numerous patents. Moreover, because of the complexity of software, it is often prohibitively expensive to even find all the patents a given software product might in principle be infringing. So even a software maker that wanted to find and license all of the patents relevant to its products is unlikely to be able to do so. Passage B Software makers like ours have consistently taken the position that patents generally impede innovation in software development and are inconsistent with open-source/free software. We will continue to work to promote this position and are pleased to join our colleagues in the open-source/free software community, as well as those proprietary vendors who have publicly stated their opposition to software patents.

In 1977 Stanley Temple, an ecologist whose investigation of Calvaria major was a sidelight to his research on endangered birds of Mauritius, proposed that the population decline of Calvaria major was linked to the demise of the dodo, a hypothesis that subsequently gained considerable currency. Temple had found only thirteen Calvaria major trees on Mauritius, all overmature and dying, and all estimated by foresters at over 300 years old. These trees produced fruits that appeared fertile but that Temple assumed could no longer germinate, given his failure to find younger trees. The temporal coincidence between the extinction of the dodo and what Temple considered the last evidence of natural germination of Calvaria major seeds led him to posit a causal connection. Specifically, he hypothesized that the fruit of Calvaria major had developed its extremely thick-walled pit as an evolutionary response to the dodo's habitual consumption of those fruits, a trait enabling the pits to withstand the abrasive forces exerted on them in the birds' digestive tracts. This defensive thickness, though, ultimately prevented the seeds within the pits from germinating without the thinning caused by abrasion in the dodo's gizzard. What had once been adaptive, Temple maintained, became a lethal imprisonment for the seeds after the dodo vanished. Although direct proof was unattainable, Temple did offer some additional findings in support of his hypothesis, which lent his argument a semblance of rigor. From studies of other birds, he estimated the abrasive force generated within a dodo's gizzard. Based on this estimate and on test results determining the crush-resistant strength of Calvaria major pits, he concluded that the pits could probably have withstood a cycle through a dodo's gizzard. He also fed Calvaria major pits to turkeys, and though many of the pits were destroyed, ten emerged, abraded yet intact. Three of these sprouted when planted, which he saw as vindicating his hypothesis.

Where Temple had found only thirteen specimens of Calvaria major, Wendy Strahm, the foremost expert on the plant ecology of Mauritius, has identified hundreds, many far younger than three centuries.

Specifically, he hypothesized that the fruit of Calvaria major had developed its extremely thick-walled pit as an evolutionary response to the dodo's habitual consumption of those fruits, a trait enabling the pits to withstand the abrasive forces exerted on them in the birds' digestive tracts. This defensive thickness, though, ultimately prevented the seeds within the pits from germinating without the thinning caused by abrasion in the dodo's gizzard. What had once been adaptive, Temple maintained, became a lethal imprisonment for the seeds after the dodo vanished. Although direct proof was unattainable, Temple did offer some additional findings in support of his hypothesis, which lent his argument a semblance of rigor. From studies of other birds, he estimated the abrasive force generated within a dodo's gizzard. Based on this estimate and on test results determining the crush-resistant strength of Calvaria major pits, he concluded that the pits could probably have withstood a cycle through a dodo's gizzard. He also fed Calvaria major pits to turkeys, and though many of the pits were destroyed, ten emerged, abraded yet intact. Three of these sprouted when planted, which he saw as vindicating his hypothesis. Though many scientists found this dramatic and intriguing hypothesis plausible, Temple's proposals have been strongly challenged by leading specialists in the field. Where Temple had found only thirteen specimens of Calvaria major, Wendy Strahm, the foremost expert on the plant ecology of Mauritius, has identified hundreds, many far younger than three centuries. So Calvaria major seeds have in fact germinated, and the tree's reproductive cycle has thus continued, since the dodo's disappearance. Additional counterevidence comes from horticultural research by Anthony Speke, which shows that while only a minority of unabraded Calvaria major seeds germinate, the number is still probably sufficient to keep this species from becoming extinct.

The immune system is an evolutionary puzzle in its own right: How is it that our bodies can quickly respond to so many different kinds of attacks? Is all this information in the genes? If so, then how does our immune system defend against new diseases? Part of the answer comes from the fact that some immune system cells contain genes that mutate with unusual frequency. The most common type of mutation is a sort of genetic \"typo\" that occurs when a cell's DNA is transcribed into RNA, the molecule that helps to assemble proteins. These mutations allow the immune system to test out different defenses until it finds one that does the job. Steele hypothesizes that the altered RNA then reverts back into DNA. Indeed, such \"reverse transcription\" of RNA back into DNA has been observed frequently in other contexts. But the troublesome question for Lamarckians is this: Could this new DNA then be carried to the reproductive genes (in the sperm and egg cells), replace the original DNA there, and so be passed on to an organism's offspring? Steele and company believe this is possible, and they have devised an elegant, but speculative, story to describe how it might happen using known biological mechanisms.

With so many athletes observing muscle memory, some plausible explanation must exist. One potential explanation of muscle memory involves the neurons (nerve cells) that stimulate your muscles, telling the muscle fibers to contract. It is well established that during weight lifting, only a small percentage of neurons for the working muscles are recruited. The more weight you lift, the more neurons are involved and the more muscle fibers are stimulated. But even when attempting your maximum weight, you don't recruit all the fibers in your working muscles. Now it could be that one way your body adapts to the demands of consistent training is by gradually increasing the percentage of muscle fibers that are stimulated by neurons during maximal lifts.

Bodybuilders who start training again after a period of inactivity find that gaining muscle size seems easier the second time around-even if starting from the same place. With so many athletes observing muscle memory, some plausible explanation must exist. One potential explanation of muscle memory involves the neurons (nerve cells) that stimulate your muscles, telling the muscle fibers to contract. It is well established that during weight lifting, only a small percentage of neurons for the working muscles are recruited. The more weight you lift, the more neurons are involved and the more muscle fibers are stimulated. But even when attempting your maximum weight, you don't recruit all the fibers in your working muscles. Now it could be that one way your body adapts to the demands of consistent training is by gradually increasing the percentage of muscle fibers that are stimulated by neurons during maximal lifts. When you're making a comeback, this ability to recruit more muscle fibers may remain intact. If so, your muscles would start with a greater capacity to develop force. Although you may think you're starting from the same place, this greater strength would enable faster progress. Then again, it's also possible that the ease of retraining has nothing to do with your muscles: it could all be in your head. The first time you trained, you didn't know how much you could lift.

Whether there was deliberate removal of tree cover to attract grazing animals or whether naturally created clearings just afforded opportunistic hunting, the common view is that clearings had an economic use. The archaeological evidence for this, however, is at best circumstantial. Some locales where the presence of clearings has been demonstrated in the paleoecological record of vegetation have also yielded human artifacts from around the same time, but the two kinds of evidence are never securely linked. Furthermore, artifactual evidence that preparation of animals for human consumption took place within or near such clearings is generally lacking. Most of the evidence invoked in favor of the resource-procurement model for clearings comes from ethnography rather than archaeology, and principally from the recognition that some recent premodern populations used fire to increase grazing areas. But while some ethnographic evidence has been used to bolster the resource-procurement model, other ethnographic evidence may suggest a different vision, a noneconomic one, of why clearings may have been deliberately created and/or used. Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan argues that right up through the modern era, human behavior has been driven by fear of the wilderness. While we might be tempted to see this kind of anxiety as a product of modern urban life, it is clear that such fears are also manifest in preliterate and nonurban societies. If we apply this insight to the Mesolithic era, our view of the purpose and use of woodland clearings may change. We have recently become aware of the importance of woodland paths in prehistory. The fact that Mesolithic human populations moved around the landscape is not a new idea. However, the fact that they may have done so along prescribed pathways has only recently come to the fore. I propose that one of the primary motivators in establishing paths may have been fear of the wooded surroundings-whether fear of harm from wildlife or spirits, or of simply getting lost.

Specific performance, as this approach is called, can be used as an alternative to monetary damages-that is, to requiring the one who has violated the agreement to pay a specified amount of money in compensation for the loss that is incurred or the wrong that is suffered. But while there are some cases for which specific performance can be a better alternative than monetary damages, there are many instances in which it is clearly not a suitable remedy. Whether or not specific performance is an appropriate remedy in a case depends on the particular characteristics of that case. It is often the only reasonable remedy when monetary damages could not adequately compensate the one who has been harmed by the breach of contract. For example, a contract may provide for one party to sell some item of personal property that is unique or of such subjective importance to the buyer that there is no way to assign an accurate financial measure of the buyer's loss in not possessing the item. When the promised seller in such a case refuses to complete the sale, the best remedy would be to order that the contract be fulfilled exactly according to its terms. Nevertheless, in many cases monetary payment can adequately compensate for the refusal to fulfill the terms of a contract, and thus the court commonly need not consider ordering specific performance. In fact, in some types of cases, court-enforced performance of the contract would actually be detrimental to those involved in the dispute and thus should be avoided. This most often occurs when a contract calls for a service to be performed and the one who has previously agreed to perform the service now refuses to do so-especially if a contract has been broken through someone's refusal to undertake employment as promised. The most compelling reasons against enforcement of contracts in such cases have to do with the kind of coercion that enforcement would necessitate. Forcing someone to perform a service in association with, and especially under the direction of, another who has become an antagonist can, at the very least, heighten dissatisfaction and intensify psychological friction.
